## Closure and replay

- Lifecycle closed: `true`.
- Environment resources reconciled: `true`.
- Declared process-time budget: `8158.454222464699` / `10440.0` s; passed `true`.
- Declared sample budget: `0.0008500000000000001` / `0.001` L.
- Exact replay: `true`; max absolute error `0.0`.
- Input/output tokens: `493092` / `2973`.
- Per-run USD price: unavailable for cached ChatGPT subscription login; no measured zero is reported.

## Existing U04 evidence

- Current fork pairs/traces/provider calls: `6` / `24` / `0`.

## Failures

None.

## Claim boundary

- One complete-agent virtual-instrument usability demonstration only.
- The endpoint score is descriptive and is not a performance threshold or ranking.
- No physical-laboratory validity or general-agent claim is made.
