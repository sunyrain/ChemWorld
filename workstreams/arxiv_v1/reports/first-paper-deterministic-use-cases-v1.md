## U03 failure and recovery

Expected rollback step: `1`; observed rollbacks: `1`; subsequent commits: `18/18`; receipt: `passed`.

## Existing evidence reused through current bindings

| Use case | Evidence | Binding SHA verified | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| U04 | single-private-component controlled world forks | yes | PASS |
| U05 | frozen unseen generated composition, first generation row | yes | PASS |

Provider calls: `0`.
Public/private leakage findings: `0`.
Missing receipts: `0`.

## Failure classes

None.

## Claim boundary

- Deterministic virtual-instrument use-case qualification only.
- The eight frozen cases are examples, not a benchmark or exhaustive task-space claim.
- No provider was called and no agent-intelligence or physical-laboratory claim is made.
