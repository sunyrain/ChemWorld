# EC-W01-B12-optimization-S-Opaque

Development experiment; one independent source session.

Status: failed; completed batches: 6/12; posttests: 0/3.

## Research assignment

You are an autonomous scientist in a simulated electrochemical laboratory.
Use only the supplied chemworld_lab tools and public_numerics calculator. No filesystem,
network, repository inspection, external knowledge retrieval, or hidden simulator access.
Read material_information first. The task's research_goal is authoritative for this campaign.
Complete 12 independent batches; repetition is allowed. You have 12 intermediate instrument
uses across the campaign plus 12 final assays. Measurements are optional up to their budget.
Use the public operation and instrument contracts and actual current legal parameter ranges.
current_mA is a nonnegative magnitude cap, not a guaranteed delivered current.
You can choose materials, conditions, segmented operation, comparisons, and measurements freely.
Later prediction will cover both potential signs, short/long electrolysis, material changes,
and current caps, at a fixed stated loading; the actual conditions are withheld until reporting.
Use English for all research notes, explanations and final reports.
There are no mandatory belief snapshots, expression templates, or decision-audit fields.
For every batch explicitly terminate then measure final_assay. A batch ending is not the
campaign ending: continue with the returned next_state until campaign_ended is true.
After the campaign ends, use commit_final_recommendation to select one completed batch
(1-based lifecycle index) as your operating recommendation, with a short rationale. For the
discovery task this recommendation is only a secondary readout. Then return the required
status/summary JSON. Keep that handoff concise: a separate turn will invite your full scientific
account, then blind prediction, then a retrospective interview. Do not answer those early.
Public scores and diagnostics are observations; supplied prior information may be incomplete
or inaccurate, and observations are authoritative. No particular scientific result is required.


Your primary goal is to find an operating procedure maximizing the public balanced-efficiency-v2 score in this electrochemical system. Choose all experiments autonomously. Use measurements and any mechanistic reasoning you find helpful.

### Question

The experimental campaign has ended and the operating recommendation is sealed.
Submit a complete, self-contained mechanism report in English. Explain how you think this
world works: important variables, relationships, couplings, possible equations or processes;
which experiments formed or changed your explanation; its scope, unidentifiable factors,
and plausible alternatives. Use natural language, mathematics or pseudocode of your choice;
no prescribed model form or certain answer is required. Cite actual batch numbers and values,
distinguishing observations, extrapolations and conjectures. Do not perform new experiments
or invent unmeasured information. Develop your account fully, rather than compressing it
into a short abstract. Return the JSON report field. Prediction questions follow sealing.

## Q

### Question

Using your own research, blindly predict the final results of these 12 independent new batches. Each starts from the same initial world state. For each metric give a point estimate and an 80% prediction interval, accounting for uncertainty. No additional experiments are allowed. Metrics follow the public instrument and scoring contracts. No mechanism form is prescribed. Do not modify your sealed report. Return complete predictions and one shared concise rationale in English; do not repeat the action lists for every question.

## K2

### Question

Your mechanism report and predictions are sealed; no prediction truth has been supplied.
Answer three questions in English, citing batch numbers without repeating your entire report:
1. Which supplied claims or self-developed laws were supported, contradicted or untested?
Which actual evidence changed your judgment? State explicitly if no instance prior was supplied.
2. With one more experiment, how would you distinguish your leading explanation from an
alternative, and how would different outcomes change your judgment? Do not execute it.
3. What evidence was unused, and which predictions or recommendations are least reliable?
Did the assigned goal affect evidence collection? It is acceptable to report no clear conflict.
Do not present hindsight as thoughts recorded at the time. Return the JSON report field.
