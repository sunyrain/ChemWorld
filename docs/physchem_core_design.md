# PhysChem Core Design

ChemWorld now includes a small `chemworld.physchem` layer. Its job is to make
the shared physical-chemical world more professional without turning the
benchmark into a heavy process simulator.

## Reference Reading

The local reference repositories were used as design references only:

- `chemicals` separates elemental bookkeeping, formula parsing, molecular
  weights, and composition utilities.
- `thermo` separates chemical constants from property-correlation packages and
  mixture state objects.
- `Cantera` uses declarative species, phase, and reaction specifications as the
  stable interface between mechanism files and numerical kernels.

ChemWorld localizes those ideas into a compact, auditable, JSON-friendly core.
No reference-project source code is copied.

## Current Scope

The first implementation slice covers the P1 TODO foundation:

- `ElementSpec`: benchmark-relevant element metadata.
- `parse_formula`: formula parsing with nested parentheses and charge stripping.
- `molecular_weight`: molecular weight from elemental composition.
- `ComponentSpec`: component identity, formula, charge, phase, safety tags, and
  allowed property-correlation IDs.
- `MixtureSpec`: self-contained mole/mass fraction state with component molecular
  weights, temperature, pressure, and phase label.
- `PropertyCorrelation`: portable correlation metadata with explicit units and
  validity ranges.

## Boundaries

This layer is intentionally not a real property package yet. It does not perform
flash calculations, EOS solves, activity-coefficient calculations, or reaction
mechanism generation. Those will be built on top of these specs in later TODO
milestones.

## Validation Rules

The core fails early when:

- a formula has unknown elements or unsupported hydrate/dot syntax;
- mole or mass fractions are negative or do not sum to one;
- mixture temperature or pressure is nonpositive;
- a component phase is outside the supported phase labels;
- a property correlation references an unsupported unit;
- a validity range is reversed or degenerate.

This gives later transition kernels a cleaner contract: invalid chemistry
metadata should fail before simulation begins.
